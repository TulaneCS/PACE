## Submission Site and Details

We invite submissions of original ongoing research focused on participatory approaches for public sector AI. Submissions should broadly align with one or more of the workshop themes of awareness, access, ability, alignment, and accessibility in public sector AI. 

## Submission Format
- **Length**: Submissions must be at most 5,000 words.
- **Categories**: We accept three types of submissions:
  - **Work-in-progress papers** Present initial research findings or innovative ideas in the early stages of development.
  - **Position papers** Offer literature reviews, reveal systematic shortcomings, or propose new Responsible AI solutions for the public sector.
  - **Artifact papers**  Include software, prototypes, pictorials, etc., described in an accompanying short paper.
- **Formatting**: Authors should prepare their submissions using the AAAI submission templates, available in both [LaTeX/Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/aaai-press-latex-template/jymjdgdpdmxp) and [Word](https://dx15.sciencesconf.org/conference/dx15/pages/dx.doc) formats, with LaTeX users encouraged to utilize Overleaf for convenient collaboration. More guidelines can be found [here.](https://aaai.org/aaai-conference/submission-instructions/) Submissions should be in accessible PDF format.

## Submission Process
All submissions will be peer-reviewed through a double-blind process. Each submission will be reviewed by at least two program committee members and one organizing committee member. Papers must be submitted anonymously as PDF documents via the [Microsoft CMT system](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/).

### Anonymity Requirements
- Authors must not reveal their identities in the submitted papers.
- Please include the submission number assigned by the CMT system in the author field.
- Refer to prior work neutrally (e.g., "XYZ et al. showed" instead of "We showed").
- It is acceptable to submit work that has been presented in public or appeared on arXiv, provided the submission itself is anonymized.

### Appendix Submission
- Consistenyly formatted appendix of any length can be added at the end of the main paper.
- Note that reviewers are not required to review the appendix, so the paper should stand on its own.

## Camera-ready Requirements
- Authors will be given an extra 1000 words to incorporate required changes from the reviewers. Final submissions can be up to 6000 words. 

## Presentation Requirements
- At least one author of each accepted paper is required to attend the workshop in-person to present the work.
- Authors must agree to this requirement at the time of submission.
