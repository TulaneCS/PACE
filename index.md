## About the Participatory AI for Community Engagement (PACE 2024) Workshop

Public sector leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the efficiency, transparency, and accountability of civic operations and public services. This includes initiatives such as predictive waste management, facial recognition for identification, and advanced tools in the criminal justice system. While public-sector AI can improve efficiency and accountability, it also has the potential to perpetuate biases, infringe on privacy, and marginalize vulnerable groups. Responsible AI (RAI) research aims to address these concerns by focusing on fairness and equity through participatory AI. We invite researchers, community members, and public sector workers to collaborate on designing, developing, and deploying RAI systems that enhance public sector accountability and transparency. Key topics include raising awareness of AI's impact on the public sector, improving access to AI auditing tools, building public engagement capacity, fostering early community involvement to align AI innovations with public needs, and promoting accessible and inclusive participation in AI development. The workshop will feature a keynote, a short paper session, and two discussion-oriented activities. Our goal is to create a platform for exchanging ideas and developing strategies to design community-engaged RAI systems while mitigating the  potential harms of AI and maximizing its benefits in the public sector.
